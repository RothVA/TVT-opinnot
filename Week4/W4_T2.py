# A4_T2 For-loop 2
# Copy the previous program and modify the behaviour to match the example program run below. 
# This program must use “for-loop” structure.
# It is recommended to replace the print-command end character with space, so that all the iterations 
# can be printed on the same row. Last iteration might require additional logic to get rid of the extra space at the end.
# Note! the autograding tool will test that the correct structure has been applied.

# Insert starting value: 11
# Insert stopping value: 15
