# A5_T7 Words in a string (TEST TASK)
# Create a Python program which collects words in a collectWords-function and analyses the words in a analyseWords-function. 
# Use main-function to define the main logic.
# Separate words with comma ',' delimiter. Define DELIMITER at the beginning of the program on the top-level as a constant variable.

# Main logic
# Call the collectWords-function and store the words into a local variable. 
# Next pass the collected words to the analyseWords-function.

# Word collecting:
# Prompt user to insert word. Repeat the prompt till the user enters an empty word.
# Collect all words into one variable where each word is separated by a DELIMITER.
# At the end of the function, return the string variable holding all of the words.

# Analysing words:
# Takes one parameter containing words wrapped into one string. Calculates the amount of words, characters and the average word length. 
# Separating words must happen by utilizing the DELIMITER. Finally displays the results. 
# Average word length must be presented in 2 decimal precision. 
# This function should not return anything.
# Use print("- {:.2f} Average word length".format(Avg)) to print average word length in 2 decimal precision.

    word_count = len(words)

    else:
        Avg = 0

    print("- {} Words".format(word_count))
    print("- {} Characters".format(total_length))
    print("- {:.2f} Average word length".format(Avg))
