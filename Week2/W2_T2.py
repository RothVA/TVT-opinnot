# Make a Python program, which prompts user for a car brand and model. After user inputs, do print the car brand and model sentence with two print commands using “sep” and “end” parameters.

# Example program run:

# Program starting.
print("Program starting")
Brand = input("Insert car brand: ")
Model = input("Insert car model: ")
# Insert car brand: Toyota
# Insert car model: Corolla
print(f"Car brand is \"{Brand}\"", end='')
print(f"and the model is '{Model}'.")
# Car brand is "Toyota" and the model is 'Corolla'.
print("Program ending")
# Program ending.
